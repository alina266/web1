<h2>zagitova 자기토바</h2><p><u><strong>The <a href="https://www.ifsmagazine.com/2021-russian-championships/" target="_blank" title="russian">2021 Russian Championships<a/></strong></u> take place at the Traktor Ice Arena in Chelyabinsk, Dec. 24-27. This competition is the primary qualifying event to earn a spot on the World Championships team. In 2018, the Russian federation amended its senior eligibility rules to permit its top junior skaters who are age eligible to compete at the senior level the following season, to compete at senior nationals in the current season.In August, the Russian Figure Skating Federation announced the rules for qualification to the Russian Championships, which required athletes to participate in two stages of the Russian Cup. However, given the number of skaters that were unable to participate in this series due to injury or illness, the federation adjusted its criteria. Only 2300 tickets were sold for this competition (approx. 35% of the venue capacity).<br><img src="https://www.nbcsports.com/sites/nbcsports.com/files/2018/09/17/dnp_oly_222_fslad_4198_zagitovafull_nbcsn.jpg" width="70%"></p><p style="margin-top:45px;"> There will be a few familiar names missing from the rosters this year. One of those is Alina Zagitova who is pursuing other options and plans to skate in shows once they resume. Sergei Voronov retired and is now coaching alongside Maxim Trankov. Artur Dmitriev, Jr. is also coaching — he has not formally retired. Ice dancers Betina Popova and Sergei Mozgov split. She retired and he is now skating with a new partner.Maria Sotskova retired in July. She is currently under investigation by RUSADA for alleged doping offences. Some of the ladies had their share of downtime in the late fall so how fast they can recover and be ready is a question mark at this time. Shcherbakova, Kostornaia and Tuktamysheva all contracted COVID-19 and are in various stages of recovery. Evgenia Medvedeva, who suffered and was hospitalized with a spinal injury in the fall also contracted a severe case of coronavirus. She will not compete but will perform in the exhibition gala.
